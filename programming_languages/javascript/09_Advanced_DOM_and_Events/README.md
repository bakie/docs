## How the DOM Really Works
* DOM is the interface between the browser and our javascript code.
* Allows us to make JavaScript interact with the browser
* We can write JavaScript to create, modify and delete HTML elements; set styles, classes and attributes; and listen and respond to events
* DOM tree is generated from an HTML document, which we can then interact with
* DOM tree is a tree like structure made out of nodes
* DOM is a very complex API that contains lots of methods and properties to interact with the DOM tree
